# Active-Directory-Labs-
This repository demonstrates practical Active Directory skills via labs focused on user/group management, domain configuration, Group Policy, and troubleshooting authentication and access. Each scenario reflects real-world tasks, emphasizing tech proficiency, customer service, and enterprise security protocols.
# Description:
I will be creating a Active Directory Homelab using Oracle VirtualBox as our hypervisor to host our Windows Server. The Windows Server is needed so that we can run Active Directory in this environment. This is accomplished by installing the Windows Server ISO directly to the VirtualBox hypervisor. From there, we have to configure our IP addresses for Domain Controller usage. This then will allow me to create users within Active Directory (setting up credentials, passwords, priviledges, etc). From there, I will demonstrate how to create a DHSP server (integral part in IP management, lease duration, and network effieciency). This will successful mimic real life applications where multiple users need to be managed within Active Directory and their profiles managed to online access, as well as, file access and management.

#  Process 
(I will be skipping the initial virtualbox install and set up as we will be focusing on setting up the Domain Controller (referred to as DC). This will require us to set up two NICs: 1) Will be fore communicating with the Internet and house our DHCP server. 2) Will be fore communicating internally (be assigned an IP address through the DHCP server of NIC (1). 

We can easily find which NIC on our VM will be used for which by checking our network connections by opening run prompt (WIN + R) and entering ncpa.cpl. This opens our Network Connections. From here, he will be right clicking each connectiona and checking both the status and IPv4 address (see image below)

Notice that Ethernet 2 has an APIPA address for its Ipv4 (169.254.x.x). This means that it cannot reach the DHCP server. This makes it easier for us to determine which of these to use for our internal communication with the VM. To make it easier to defferenciate, I will rename them "_INTERNET_" for our DHCP server/connection to the internet and "X_Internet_X" for our internal VM connection.  

Next, we will be configuring the Internal network adapter by assigning it a static IP address, subnet mask, and DNS server address. I can skip the default gateway input due to the Domain Controller being the gateway. In addition the DNS server will be assigned a loop back address, seeing as Active Directory will take care of the DNS allocation.

Now that I know which NIC is internal and external, I am going to rename the PC for cohesion and ease. This requires a restart. <img width="1013" height="875" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/91ca5347-1786-4849-b34f-72fc3a212a90" />

From here we will be installing Active Directory on our newly named PC. This is done by using the roles and features wizard within Server Manager.
<img width="1012" height="877" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2965f1cf-9f1f-43bf-9a30-65d976405841" />
 <img width="1020" height="874" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9f1ad0bb-dc5b-40c9-8ba8-a5eda494bf55" />

Once the install is complete, I will promote the server toa domain controller using the drop down menu in Server Manager
<img width="1014" height="882" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9e033f40-c0ae-42e5-a1bc-93de145ffedb" /> 

This will bring up another configuration wizard. From here, I will follow the wizard and name my domain, add a password and install. 
<img width="1020" height="876" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/dccc87ae-bb44-4d01-b3f4-269045987c76" />

<img width="1020" height="876" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6dfb8583-f51d-4273-a5c4-e22d0b02a6b8" />

After a successful install, the VM will restart. From here, I will go to Start > Administrative Tools > Active Directory Users and Computers and right click my new domain (mydomain.com) and then go to new > organizational unit.<img width="1017" height="872" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/adde4d19-0a3b-49e6-b7b6-56f9288a04d7" />

From here, I will name it _ADMINS and make sure the "Protect container from accidental deletion" is checked. <img width="1018" height="880" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6194dc60-efab-4955-8be6-99b0e9abe015" />

From here, I will creating a user within Active Directory. This is done by right clicking _Admins and click new > user and fill out the information with my name and then the username. After clicking next, I will be prompted to make and confirm my password for this account. I will make sure that this password never expires (which isn't preferred in the real world, but for ease in this lab- I have) 
<img width="1025" height="877" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d62eff4e-a765-43d6-b666-59a09117b26f" />
<img width="1019" height="862" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4df268ac-2946-4260-ab6b-4a0c72646b3c" />

Now I will make this user a member of the Domain Admins group. This done by right-clicking the user name, going down to Properties, and clicking the "member of" tab. From here, I will click the add button and type in "Domain Admins" and press check names. Then press ok and apply.  
<img width="1014" height="877" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/af9ef8cb-498f-4d3d-96c7-d12e24d2348b" />

Now, we want to make it so that the client can access the internet through the domain controller and virtual network; 
and this is done by using Remote Access Server (RAS) / Network Access Translation (NAT). This must be added to the Domain Controller. In Server Manager, I will go to Add roles and features and then weâ€™re going to check Remote Access and then click next and next again to check the Routing box and add it, then next through until you click install. After the install, I clicked on tools and scrolled down to Routing and Remote Access. 
<img width="622" height="447" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/39a8f286-d6f5-4ab0-9ab8-5548da5d424e" />

From here, I right clicked DC (local) > Configure and Enable Routing and Remote Access and then selected NAT.<img width="623" height="446" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/eb2bf16d-2d2a-43af-a20f-8363e973c2c3" />

This is where the previously renamed NICs will come in handy, I have to select which will be the public interface to connect to the Internet. I will select the appropriately named NIC, _INTERNET_ and click finish. <img width="624" height="447" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d9c1b5c1-24f8-4232-bb99-04207978f254" />

I now have to configure the DNS Server to run on my Domain Controller. I will go back to Add Roles and Features in the Server Manager. However, this time I will be choosing the DHCP Server option and continue to follow the wizard until the install is complete. <img width="777" height="560" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/91aed694-9c3f-4d3c-ba4e-982bb926b084" />
