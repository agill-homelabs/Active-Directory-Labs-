# Active-Directory-Labs-
This repository demonstrates practical Active Directory skills via labs focused on user/group management, domain configuration, Group Policy, and troubleshooting authentication and access. Each scenario reflects real-world tasks, emphasizing tech proficiency, customer service, and enterprise security protocols.
# Description:
I will be creating a Active Directory Homelab using Oracle VirtualBox as our hypervisor to host our Windows Server. The Windows Server is needed so that we can run Active Directory in this environment. This is accomplished by installing the Windows Server ISO directly to the VirtualBox hypervisor. From there, we have to configure our IP addresses for Domain Controller usage. This then will allow me to create users within Active Directory (setting up credentials, passwords, priviledges, etc). From there, I will demonstrate how to create a DHSP server (integral part in IP management, lease duration, and network effieciency). This will successful mimic real life applications where multiple users need to be managed within Active Directory and their profiles managed to online access, as well as, file access and management.
